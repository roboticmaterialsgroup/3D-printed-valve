# 3D printed valve
A 3D printed valve is a device that has a membrane that opens or closes tubing depending on the way the membrane is flipped; acting analogously to a CMOS transistor in an electrical circuit. The soft fluidic valve can be configured as either an OR-gate, an AND-gate, or a NOT-gate.
