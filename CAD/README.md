This folder contains everything you need to fabricate and use the 3D printed valves. \
Details on how to fabricate, assemble and configure the soft valves are detailed in [this document](https://github.com/roboticmaterialsgroup/3D-printed-valve/blob/master/fabrication/Bi-stable_Valve_Fabrication_Instructions.pdf). \
The CAD file, stl file, gcode, printer configurations are also provided here. \
Here contains two valve designs, one is mono-stable, the other is bi-stable. \
Each design consists of a body, two caps, and an optional stage. \
A design of a pnumatic pixel display is also presented. \
This pixel display can show different colors on its top side depending on if you apply positive pressure to it.
