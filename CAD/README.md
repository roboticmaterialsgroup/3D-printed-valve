This folder encompasses all the necessary files for fabricating and utilizing the 3D printed valves. It includes CAD files, STL files, G-code, and printer configurations. Within, you'll find two valve designs— one mono-stable and the other bi-stable— each comprising a body, two caps, and an optional stage. Additionally, a design for a pneumatic pixel display is provided, capable of displaying colors on its top side based on applied positive pressure.
